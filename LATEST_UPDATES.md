# Latest Updates

I've applied the visual refinements you requested!

## Updates Made

1. **Slideshow Quotes**:
    - Now perfectly **centered** using Flexbox layout logic.
    - Added **text shadow** for better visibility on all images.
    - Ensured they stay within the screen bounds on mobile.

2. **Translucent Card**:
    - Updated the final card to be **translucent** (60% opacity) with a blur effect.
    - You can now see the floating love quotes gliding behind the card!

The code is built and ready. Run `npm run dev` to see the beautiful new look! ✨
